Git

Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used for managing and tracking changes in software development projects.

Here are some of the most commonly used Git commands:

- git init: initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

- git clone "repository_url": creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.

- git add "file": stages changes for commit. You can also use "git add ." to stage all changes.

- git commit -m "commit message": records the staged changes in the repository with a descriptive message.

- git status: shows the status of your working directory, indicating which files are changed, staged, or untracked.

- git log: displays a history of commits.

- git branch: lists all branches in the repository and indicates the current branch.

- git checkout "branch_name": switches to the specified branch.

- git branch "new_branch_name": creates a new branch.

- git merge "branch_name": merges changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

- git pull: fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

- git push: pushes your local changes to a remote repository.

- git remote -v: lists the remote repositories connected to your local repository.

- git fetch: fetches changes from a remote repository but doesn't merge them into your local branch.

- git reset "file": unstages changes for the specified file.

- git reset --hard "commit_hash": resets the current branch to a specific commit, discarding all changes after that commit.

- git stash: temporarily saves your changes and reverts the working directory to the last commit.

- git stash pop: restores the changes from the last stash.

- git diff: shows the differences between the working directory and the last commit.

- git remote add "remote_name" "remote_url": adds a remote repository to your Git configuration.

- git remote remove "remote_name": removes a remote repository from your Git configuration.
